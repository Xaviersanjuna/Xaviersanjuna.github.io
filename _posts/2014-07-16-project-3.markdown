Xavier’s is all about the food - dishes with original recipes. Returning customers, a prominent number of guests and employees from 5 star hotels who dine here, are testimony to this. With traditional cooking styles, especially recipes passed down from generations, a good meal is assured.

The restaurant specialises in seafood, Indian and Goan cuisine. It has a seating capacity of about seventy. Guests are encouraged to choose their own fish, crabs or lobsters from a big tray with the day’s fresh catch placed nearby. Most of all, what diners swear by is the Beef Steak in Balsamic Sauce served on a good helping of mashed potatoes.

But now Xaviers is an in house restaruant for the guest house with a very short menu and any special orders has to be placed few days before like the Stuffed crabs and lobsters.
